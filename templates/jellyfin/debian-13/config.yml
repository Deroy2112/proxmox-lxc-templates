faq:
  - question: How do I add media libraries?
    answer: |
      Mount your media folders as bind mounts in Proxmox (e.g., /media/movies),
      then add them as libraries in Jellyfin's web UI under Dashboard > Libraries.
  - question: How do I enable hardware transcoding?
    answer: |
      Pass through your GPU in Proxmox container settings,
      then enable hardware acceleration in Dashboard > Playback > Transcoding.
  - question: How do I access Jellyfin remotely?
    answer: |
      Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx) with SSL,
      or use Jellyfin's built-in HTTPS on port 8920.
